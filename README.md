## What is this?

This is a repository for learning AI, I started the journey following the excellent [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/) course, and I will continue to add more stuff as I learn more.

## Available notebooks

- `notebooks/jupyter-notebook-101.ipynb` is a notebook to learn the basics of jupyter notebooks
- `notebooks/is-it-a-bird/is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data.ipynb` is a notebook to learn how to create a model from your own data using a birds recognizer as an example (image classifier)
- `notebooks/pets-recognizer/pets-recognizer.ipynb` is a notebook using an existing data set to distinguish between cats and dogs (image classifier)
- `notebooks/movies-reviews-sentiment-analysis/movies-reviews-sentiment-analysis.ipynb` is a notebook using an existing data set to distinguish between positive and negative movie reviews (sentiment analysis)
- `notebooks/income-predictor/income-predictor.ipynb` is a notebook using an existing data set to predict if a person makes more than 50k a year (tabular data analysis)

## Contribution guidelines

dear past, present, and future contributors, you have my many thanks, but please follow these guidelines:

- please use comments to explain your code, even if it's obvious to you, it might not be to someone else
