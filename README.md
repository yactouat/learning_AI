## What is this?

This is a repository for learning AI, I started the journey following the excellent [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/) course, and I will continue to add more stuff as I learn more.

You should use it with Visual Studio Code, Docker, and the dev container configuration that is included in this repository. Dev container has been tested with a Windows 11 laptop equiped with an Nvidia GPU the NVidia CUDA Toolkit.

- please use comments to explain your code, even if it's obvious to you, it might not be to someone else
- you are free to arrange the code, the folder structure, the file names, etc. as you see fit if you're able to provide a good reason for it

that's all, thank you for your time !
