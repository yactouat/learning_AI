    "## Using a linear model with SGD to classify digits\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, we will need a kind of weight assignmen and a way of improving our classifier based on testing the effectiveness of this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Stochastic gradient descent_ is a technique used to update the weights of a neural network in order to make it improve at any given task. Its power resides in the fact that it provides a way of finding weight values automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of trying to find the similarity between an image and an \"ideal image,\" we could instead look at each individual pixel and come up with a set of weights for each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, pixels toward the bottom right are not very likely to activate neurons for a 7, so they should have a low weight for a 7, but they are likely to be activated for an 8, so they should have a high weight for an 8. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be represented as a function with a set of weight values for each possible category, for instance the probability of being the number 8 =>\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def pr_eight(image_vector, weights_vector): return (image_vector * weights_vector).sum()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the image represented as a vector is basically \"all the rows stacked up end to end on a single long line\". With this kind of function, we just need some way to update the weights to make them better and better at distinguishing between digits: we want to find the specific values for the weights that cause the result of our function to be high for images that are actually 8s, and low for images that are not. Searching for the best weights is a way of searching for the best function that recognizes 8s.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the steps that will turn our function into a machine learning classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _initialize_ the weights with random values\n",
    "2. for each image, use these weights to predict whether it appears to be a given digit\n",
    "3. based on these predictions, calculate how good the model is (its _loss_)\n",
    "4. calculate the _gradient_, which measures for each weight, how changing that weight would change the loss; the gradients will tell us how much we have to change each weight to make our model better\n",
    "5. _step_ (that is, _change_) all the weights based on the previous calculation\n",
    "6. go back to step 2 and repeat the process\n",
    "7. iterate until you decide to stop the training process (for instance, because the model is good enough or you don't want to wait any longer). Generally, you would want to stop the training process when the model stops improving or gets worse\n",
    "\n",
    "These relatively simple steps are the basis for nearly all deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we know how a function changes, we know what we need to make its value smaller. This is what weights assignment is all about.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing to be aware of is that our function has lots of weights that we need to adjust, so when we calculate the derivative of these weights we won't get back one number, but rather lots of them: a _gradient_ for every weight. But there is nothing mathematically tricky here; you can calculate the derivative with respect to one weight, and treat all the other ones as constant, then repeat that for each other weight. This is how all of the gradients are calculated, for every weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, `PyTorch` can automatically compute the derivative of nearly any function!\n",
    "Adjusting the weights of our model can be then expressed as simply as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\t\n",
    "weights -= gradient * lr\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what _stepping the weights_ actually means.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a substraction here to allow for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- in case the slope is positive, the weight to be decreased\n",
    "- in case the slope is negative, the weight to be increased\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: our ultimate goal is to minimize the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's summarize a few points here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The weights of a model can be random (training a model from scratch) or they can come from a pre trained model (transfer learning).\n",
    "- If you train a model from scratch, the first outputs you'll get will probably be pretty bad, because your weights are random.\n",
    "- Also, in case of a pretrained model, the first outputs won't probably be what you want, because the model was trained for a different task. So, the model will need to _learn_ better weights.\n",
    "- To measure the performance of a model, you compare the outputs the model gives you with the targets (the true labels), using a loss function.\n",
    "- We want the output of the loss function to be as low as possible by improving the weights of the model.\n",
    "- For improving the model, you'd want to set aside a few data items that you don't train the model on, called the _validation set_. This is the set that will be used to measure performance.\n",
    "- Figuring out how to change the loss to make it better heavily relies on Calculus and gradients. This is made easy with tools like `PyTorch` 😎.\n",
    "- At each pass of the iterative process that makes the weights better, we use the magnitude of each gradient to tell us how big a step is to take into a better direction. We multiply the gradients by a number called the _learning rate_ to decide each step size.\n",
    "- When the loss does not get any better, we say that the model has _converged_ and we stop the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, we are ready to apply this to the MNIST dataset now !\n",
